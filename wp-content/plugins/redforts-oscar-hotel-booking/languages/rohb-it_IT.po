#~ "This plugin allows you to add a reservation widget to your website  in an easy way. You can add as many widgets as you need, all of them will be shown in the style you selected on this page.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The simplest widget offers the possibility to select the arrival and departure dates and a button to show the possible options for the dates.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "To use this type of widget on your page, you only need add the following shortcode: <strong><pre>[rdf-booking-widget]</strong></pre> to the page.\n"
#~ "If you like you can change the default text of the button by adding the «button_txt=» tag to the shortcode.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For instance:\n"
#~ "<strong><pre>[rdf-booking-widget button_txt='Check Availability!']<strong></pre>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You may wish to add a widget to pages that show a specific accommodation and allow the visitor to book the specific room shown. This can be done by adding the «acco=» tag to the shortcode. You can find the acco codes in the Oscar PMS on <a href=\"https://oscar.redforts.com/setup,be,linkbuilder\">this page</a>.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Let's suppose the accommodation id is 1, the shortcode would then be:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "<strong><pre>[rdf-booking-widget acco=1]<strong></pre>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You may add all the different tag options to the shortcode like:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "<strong><pre>[rdf-booking-widget button_txt='Check availability in this room' acco=1]<strong></pre>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You can even pre-select specific rates. Check the rate ids in Oscar, and then include them in the shortcode:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "<strong><pre>[rdf-booking-widget rate=3]<strong></pre>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Remember you may combine different options:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "<strong><pre><strong><pre>[rdf-booking-widget acco=1 rate=3]<strong></pre>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If you still have questions go to the <a href=\"https://oscar.redforts.com/setup,be,linkbuilder\">shortcode builder</a> page in Oscar, which automatically builds the shortcode for you."
