<h1>Widgets</h1>
<p>
    You can insert the reservation widget in any of the widget areas your Wordpress template offers. Check out the administrative area of Wordpress at  <a href="widgets.php"><?php _e('Appearance'); ?> - <?php _e('Widgets'); ?></a> to see what widget areas are offered.

<p>
    You can add the reservation widget by dragging the <strong>Redforts booking widget</strong> to the widget area you would like it to be shown. Once placed in the area of your choice, customise it to your needs.
