If you’ve ever suffered through a click-next-to-continue PowerPoint coma and decided elearning isn’t for you, we want you to give it another look. Allen doesn’t do elearning templates with dropped-in blocks of text. We bring programming experience to save you money, and combine it with custom-designed elearning. Every company has unique business objectives, so a one-size-fits-all elearning template just won’t cut it.

We start our designs from scratch every time—not matching the client’s needs to what we can do, but matching what we should do to the client’s needs. Sadly, some learners have come to dread web-based training because they’ve seen uninteresting, poorly designed courses in the past. Interactivity is key to any online offering. Allen’s elearning is designed to communicate and apply relevant information while engaging learners. We want people to finish training satisfied with having learned something interesting and helpful.

Your learners—internal or external—deserve to have their needs addressed. We take time in the design phase to make sure every interaction, every interface element, every click or touch means something. This could include different paths for unique audiences, pre-assessments to guide them through training, self-guided menus to put them in the driver’s seat, simulations that mimic real applications, games to put them in challenging situations, storytelling videos that highlight experts in their field, or simple assessments that require critical thinking rather than memorization. We also use the highest quality media treatments, motion design, mobile-forward designs, and beautifully branded visuals to ensure your brand’s credibility is enhanced by the learning exchange, not challenged by it.
